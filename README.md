# Warning!
	I'm fairly new to dotfiles and bash, this was working for me during the tests, if there's a problem with the .sh files i may take a look and solve some issues!
	You also need to give chmod 777 for them in order to work.


# Setup.sh
	This will install dunst components as well dependencies, it will also compile and install it.
#install.sh 
	It will clone the main repository and copy all the dotfiles to the main folder (~/) which will enable the theme, mostly likely you will need to reconfigure openbox to set everything right.
